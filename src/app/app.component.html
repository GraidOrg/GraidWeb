        The Problem: Professors Can't Personalize Learning
      </h2>
      <p class="card-description">
        Professors struggle to personalize learning according to student needs
        because they don't know what everyone's individual needs are. We spoke
        with over 200 professors and they see AI's potential to personalize
        learning, but they can't influence how students use the AI.
      </p>
      <p class="card-description">
        Research shows that students who use AI effectively can get better test
        scores, but MIT research showed that students misusing AI leads to less
        brain activity.

      <h2 class="card-title">The Solution: Graid</h2>
      <p class="card-description">
        Graid is a vision and voice AI tutor that reports student needs to
        professors. Current AI solutions lean toward giving the answers; Graid
        uses research-based tutoring principles to guide students through the
        work instead of giving them the answers.
      </p>
      <p class="card-description">
        Graid pinpoints exactly where students struggle—and turns that into
        action for professors: suggesting personalized worksheets, and real-time
        maps of class mastery. So professors can personalize learning without
        guessing.
      </p>
      <p class="card-description">
        Graid will also integrate with Canvas and other learning management
        systems, and is fine-tuned to improve accuracy in recognizing
        handwriting.

      <h2 class="card-title">The Market Opportunity</h2>
      <p class="card-description">
        The tutoring market is worth billions, and local universities spend
        around $300K a year on math labs alone. We offer Graid to administrators
        and capture these funds by enhancing learning, giving teachers
        actionable insights, and giving administrators measurable proof of
        impact.
